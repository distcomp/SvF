# SvF
Implementation of SvF-technology of regularized identification of mathematical models by experimental data.

The technology of balanced identification of mathematical models (the so-called SvF-technology, from Simplicity vs Fitting) proposes a promising area of applied mathematics, combining methods of structural mathematical modeling, optimization, adaptive regularization and distributed computing.

The author of the SvF-technology is [Alexander Sokolov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=mtE_u_YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), [sashasok](https://gitlab.com/sashasok).

Current repository is the public version of [private SvF](https://gitlab.com/sashasok/svf)

# How to clone
Current implementation of the SvF-technolosy is based on [Everest Python API](https://gitlab.com/everest/python-api) and [SSOP Everest Application](https://optmod.distcomp.org/apps/vladimirv/solve-set-opt-probs). **So, use the following command for correct cloning**

`$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:distcomp/SvF.git`
