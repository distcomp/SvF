Implementation of SvF-technology of regularized identification of mathematical models by experimental data.

The technology of balanced identification of mathematical models (the so-called SvF-technology, from Simplicity vs Fitting) proposes a promising area of applied mathematics, combining methods of structural mathematical modeling, optimization, adaptive regularization and distributed computing.

The author of the SvF-technology is [Alexander Sokolov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=mtE_u_YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), [sashasok](https://gitlab.com/sashasok).
